# Emby Wiki

## What is Emby

Emby is a streaming service that allows you to watch movies, TV shows, and other media on your computer, smartphone, tablet, or smart TV. It's like having your own personal Netflix or Amazon Prime Video, but with content curated by someone you know and trust instead of a faceless corporation.
