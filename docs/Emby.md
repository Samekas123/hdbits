## ⚙️4K Settings/Direct Play

``` py
TV-based apps often struggle to deliver optimal 4K playback because they may lack support for all codecs and audio formats
```

``` py
For a smoother 4K experience, consider using a dedicated playback device like the Apple TV 4K
```

**Important:** Avoid using **PGSSUB** subtitles with 4K playback!

**Recommended Settings:**

- Settings -> Playback -> Video Quality

- Internet quality: Set to **4K-200Mbps** or set max **streaming bitrate to maximum!**

- Maximum Allowed Video Transcoding Resolution: 4K

For web app/generic android boxes:

For the Nvidia Shield TV:
